Building an Angular web app with a Flask API using PyTorch for ML features.

The purpose of this system is to assist players of Generation 3 Pokémon games in building a balanced in-game team by parsing uploaded save files to extract owned Pokémon and generating a recommended team using in-game logic.

The system prioritizes low-friction user experience, minimal manual input, and high data correctness over competitive optimization, while keeping the architecture ready for future ML-based perception and recommendation.
